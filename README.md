## Color Blind Simulator
To use the color blind simulator, either compile this project and place the DLL and the 'Shaders' folder somewhere under your 'Assets' folder, or copy ColorBlindSimulator.cs and the 'Shaders' folder somewhere under your 'Assets' folder. Then place the ColorBlindSimulator component onto the camera which should simulate color blindness. You can use the drop down menu to select a type of color blindness to simulate.
